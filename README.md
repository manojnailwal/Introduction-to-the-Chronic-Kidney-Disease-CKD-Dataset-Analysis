# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Dataset Analysis

## üìä Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset**. The dataset contains vital information about patients, including their **age**, **blood pressure**, **blood sugar levels**, and other medical factors. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that can aid in the **early diagnosis** of CKD.

By performing this analysis, we explore important features, check for missing or duplicate data, and visualize various statistical relationships to better understand the underlying trends in the dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
This project utilizes several Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. Here are the key tools used:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static plots and visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning modeling and preprocessing.

## üìà Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was collected from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease).
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Checking and handling **null values**.
   - Removing **duplicate rows**.
   - **Changing data types** for categorical and numerical columns.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Univariate analysis with histograms, box plots, and violin plots.
   - Bivariate and multivariate analysis using **correlation heatmaps** and **pair plots**.
   - Identifying and handling **outliers** using IQR (Interquartile Range).
   - Visualizing relationships with **scatter plots**, **pie charts**, and **swarm plots**.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance and analyzing their importance.

## üß∞ Setup and Installation
To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manojnailwal/CKD-EDA-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CKD-EDA-Analysis
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. You can use **`requirements.txt`** to install all necessary libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `CKD_EDA_Analysis.ipynb` file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## üîç Visualizations
Some of the key visualizations generated during the analysis include:

- **Correlation Heatmap**: To examine correlations between different features.
- **Pair Plots**: To visualize relationships between pairs of features.
- **Boxplots & Violin Plots**: To identify outliers and distribution of features.
- **Bar Charts & Pie Charts**: To visualize categorical data.

Examples of the output visualizations can be found in the Jupyter notebook.

## üí° Key Findings
- There is a **strong correlation** between certain features like **age**, **blood pressure**, and **serum creatinine**.
- **Outliers** were detected in features such as **blood glucose**, which may require further preprocessing for modeling.
- Several **missing values** were imputed with **mean/median** values depending on the feature.
